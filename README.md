# uMessenger 2.0 (with GUI)

Small Messenger-like application now with user interface, and works on the same LAN only (unless using NAT on the server side with a Raspberry for example). **It's important to have userList.txt on the directory where the server is.**

If you wanna try it yourself you can either:

- Download the zip of the full repository and compile it yourself on your favourite IDE.

- Or download the zip file for being either a server or a client and run the corresponding .jar from the command line. Click on one of the rar files, and in the upper right corner, click on raw to download it.

 _Inside the rar there are .cmd files that executes `java -jar uMessenger_Client.jar` in a new command window (perfect for lazy people like myself)_.
