# uMessenger 2.0 (with GUI)

Small Messenger-like application now with user interface, and works on the same LAN only (unless using NAT on the server side with a Raspberry for example).

If you wanna try it yourself you can either:

- Download the zip of the full repository and compile it yourself on your favourite IDE.

- Or download the jar files for being either a server or a client, and run any of them by double clicking. (The server has no UI, so once you double-click you will not see anything, but it will be running anyway).
